I. Coordinate Spaces
--------------------
The visualization of the 2D inventory array is Row Column. 
Therefore, the array is the transpose of the grid ui.

The coordinate space of the grid is 
^ Y-
|
|    X+
 ---->
 
The coordinate space of anchored position property of 
the Inventory Item UI Rect Transform looks like:
^ Y+
|
|    X+
 ----> 
^Notice the y coordinate is flipped. 

Also the rect transform's coordinate origin is the center of the grid, 
wheras the grid's origin is the upper left corner.
