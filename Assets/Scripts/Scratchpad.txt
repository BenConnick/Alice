Shift from long levels to spelunky random sections
Work out what parts are needed and how to keep it flexible
Build the level on start instead of mid-level, 
but try to write it so we could support hotswapping

Idea: mirrors that flip the section you just played

Re-make the dialogue UI for the Above sections
Add an Above section

Next steps:
* find more fun gameplay
** change the platform movement mechanics to use platforms for horizontal jumping
** change the platform fx to show the platform pushed away zero-g style
* refactor game state changes
** game objects fire enum events to the game manager, which controls state changes in a single function
** simplify GM - subsystem interface (fewer public entry points)
** remove Game Over booleans, replace with game state / mode
** come up with a name for the events that the UI recieves (AnimationEvent? FXEvent?)
* increase eye collider size
* figure out the tone [see wiki 11/21]
